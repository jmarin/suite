Description: The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)
 The Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) is a unifying C/C++ API for 
 accessing raster geospatial data, and currently includes formats like 
 GeoTIFF, Erdas Imagine, Arc/Info Binary, CEOS, DTED, GXF, and SDTS. It is 
 intended to provide efficient access, suitable for use in viewer 
 applications, and also attempts to preserve coordinate systems and 
 metadata. Perl, C, and C++ interfaces are available.

Description: Geospatial Data Abstraction Library - Utility programs
 GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats.
 As a library, it presents a single abstract data model to the
 calling application for all supported formats. The related OGR
 library (which lives within the GDAL source tree) provides
 a similar capability for simple features vector data.
 .
 GDAL supports 40+ popular data formats, including commonly used
 ones (GeoTIFF, JPEG, PNG and more) as well as the ones used in
 GIS and remote sensing software packages (ERDAS Imagine,
 ESRI Arc/Info, ENVI, PCI Geomatics). Also supported many remote
 sensing and scientific data distribution formats such as HDF,
 EOS FAST, NOAA L1B, NetCDF, FITS.
 .
 OGR library supports popular vector formats like ESRI Shapefile,
 TIGER data, S57, MapInfo File, DGN, GML and more.
 .
 This package contains utility programs, based on GDAL/OGR library,
 namely gdal_translate, gdalinfo, gdaladdo, gdalwarp, ogr2ogr, ogrinfo,
 ogrtindex.
